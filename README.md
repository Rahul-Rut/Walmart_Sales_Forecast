# Walmart Sales Forecast

This repository contains relevant files and code used in the project of forecasting Walmart Sales, based on the Kaggle dataset provided [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data). In this project, we implemented various Statistical methods for Forecasting Time Series (including ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, VARMA) and compared their performances.
